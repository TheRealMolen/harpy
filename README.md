# harpy

daisyseed firmware for a nice wee harp, with any luck


## setup
1. download & configure the DaisyExamples as described in [https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyWiki/wiki/1.-Setting-Up-Your-Development-Environment]
2. clone this repo into the same folder as the DaisyExamples folder so they're siblings

## layout
breadboarded up something like the daisy pod: [https://github.com/electro-smith/Hardware/raw/master/reference/daisy_pod/ES_Daisy_Pod_Rev3.pdf]
